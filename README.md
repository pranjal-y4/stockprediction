# Stock Prediction Using Tensorflow

Machine learning is a great opportunity for non-experts to be able to predict accurately and gain steady fortune and may help experts to get the most informative indicators and make better predictions.
Predicting stock prices has always been an attractive topic to both investors and researchers. Investors always question if the price of a stock will rise or not, since there are many complicated financial indicators that only investors and people with good finance knowledge can understand, the trend of stock market is inconsistent and look very random to ordinary people.
You would like to model stock prices correctly, so as a stock buyer you can reasonably decide when to buy stocks and when to sell them to make a profit. This is where time series modeling comes in. You need good machine learning models that can look at the history of a sequence of data and correctly predict what the future elements of the sequence are going to be.
